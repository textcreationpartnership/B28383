            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am much beholding to you for ſuch occurrences as I have received from you, and I can do no leſſe than take this opportunity to gratifie you by way of relation: We are both for the King, and therefore I need not ſtraiten my ſelfe, but ſpeake liberally my thoughts concerning his Majeſties affaires.</p>
            <p>We laid for our ſelves a very reaſonable foundation, for when we could not make <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> ſo much ours, as we deſired, nor poſſeſſe our ſelves of <hi>Hull,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Hotham,</hi> (being too much injured and weakned by the loſſe of the Navy) we thought it ſafeſt to be aſſured of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:197617:3"/>
               <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and ſo to be ſecured, as to the <hi>Scots</hi> (for we know they are too apt to thinke that <hi>England</hi> is a better ſoyle than theirs) as alſo to place a Generall (my Lord <hi>Cumberland</hi>) with a conſiderable ſtrength of Horſe in <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> and a more conſiderable power, the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Eyre</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> to ſecure us from any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and thoſe multitude of <hi>Round-heads</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-riding,</hi> and ſo to preſerve the peace of that County, that ſo, if they do us not that good we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected yet they may not annoy us, and lay obſtructions in our way. To the ſame purpoſe his Majeſty did pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently take <hi>pro conceſſo,</hi> in all his Speeches, that that County was his (though we knew to the contrary) and that neither He nor His Poſterity ſhould forget their loyalty, (which let me tell you is not worth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring.)</p>
            <p>Well we leave them (who deſerve not our owning) and having iſſued out Commiſſions for Horſe, and a ful Infantery, at leaſt 16000, we were content, it ſhould be given out, we would draw towards the <hi>West,</hi> but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon the <hi>South,</hi> &amp; to make <hi>Nottingham</hi> our Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous, <hi>Leiceſterſh. Northamptonſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſh.</hi> the Seat of our War; <hi>Nottingham</hi> being a place every way well fortified, (fit to ſecure His Majeſties Perſon, our Magazine, and to make our retreat to, if need were, and the other Countie (chiefly <hi>Leiceſterſh,</hi>) being abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proviſioned for Horſe and man (which would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence our want of moneys when our ſtock is ſpent) and repleniſhed with ſtore of <hi>Round-heads,</hi> a good prey and encouragement for our Souldiers: In thoſe ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we deſigned to ſtrengthen our ſelves, with the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197617:3"/>of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the Caſtle, <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton;</hi> only there was an unhappy miſtake, for at that time when we went for <hi>Warwick,</hi> we ſhould have gone to <hi>Northampton;</hi> The caſt of a Dye did it ſuch avidents the greateſt and beſt deſignes are ſubject to.</p>
            <p>Thus I give you the reaſon of that foundation wee thought beſt to lay, and upon which wee had as good reaſon to conclude, that we might have built upon it (which we deſired) a monument of Honour to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſome ſhare of that to our ſelves, and plenty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: For let me tell you, if we had once been thus well provided for, ſet down in the foreſaid Counties, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to our ſelves thoſe Townes (where would have been a prety beginning of encouragement to our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; We would in a ſhort time by the helpe of the Commiſſion of Array (and that of Eyre and Terminer too, if need had been) have made better proviſion for our ſelves at <hi>London,</hi> for we have a juſt ſenſe of all their practiſes againſt us, and where the foundation of our miſchiefe was laid.</p>
            <p>Now I muſt tell you in your eare, It is our unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, our Plot is much weakned, for <hi>Petoes</hi> holding out <hi>Warwick</hi> Caſtle beyond all expectation till ſuccours came neere him, and <hi>Coventry</hi> following <hi>Hotham</hi> and his ſteps, and our enemies force comming upon us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were aware, or indeed prepared for them, and they underſtanding our deſigne (and all openings are weaknings) and preſent condition by ſome that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, but not of us, hath done us ſo much miſchiefe, that I can by no meanes like of His Majeſties preſent condition: Our retreat at <hi>Southampton</hi> was an ill omen
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:197617:4"/>and though we loſt not many men, for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were prudent, and marched away orderly, yet we ſtrengthned our adverſaries hands and weakned our own. But beſides, the Gentry of theſe Counties do not draw after them ſuch numbers of commons as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty preſumed upon, and we are not aſſured of the Trained bands any where.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Leicesterſhiere</hi> upon frequent ſummons, they came in thinly, and on Tueſday laſt at <hi>Leicester,</hi> they were ſo bold as openly to ſay they were for the King and <hi>Parliament,</hi> wee know that language well enough. In <hi>Nottingam-ſhiere</hi> wee cannot ſecure our ſelves in any, but Captaine <hi>Digbies</hi> band, and hence our Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime is not to truſt the trained band, but we will make the beſt uſe of them we can, and that is of their armes, which I may tell you we have need enough of, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that we have but an indifferent number, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come at them: Some ſay that <hi>Yorkſhiere</hi> will not ſupply the King, with carriages to bring them, the Officers may be bribed, ſomething is in the wind, and when they come, we ſhall be defective as to that part.</p>
            <p>Our Infantarie cannot encourage a temperate man, for we have not above 1200. Their poverty I paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for we may make them richer in time, but many are too young, raw, and moſt very uncapable of diſcipline. We have prety ſtore of Horſe, ſome ſay there are 5000 or more, I cannot ſay (for I muſt ſpeak the truth) more than 2000, if ſo many. Here we make good uſe of the Catholicks, but your Citizens Horſe, ſure are fed like Aldermen to theſe, they look very poorely, and ſurely the Captain upon advance money deceived too purpoſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:197617:4"/>for many horſes are not worth 5 Marks, &amp; many a troop hath but 40 horſe, this the Captains put up as their own. But the Kings guard troop, the Prince, Prince <hi>Rob.</hi> the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> and S. <hi>William Penniman,</hi> are very wel ſet off, only one thing becauſe I am a Proteſtant, I muſt not like nor owne that many of the Kings guard troop are Papiſts, and there are ſome Popiſh Commanders, how this come about I know not, ſpecially ſeeing it is a principle with the wiſeſt, that no Papiſts ſhould have command, for feare of the ill report it would make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Kings Leidge people, another thing I diſlike, that the Iriſh Commanders are paid &amp; not the Engliſh, which in time will diſcontent them, and diſſervice the King: Our Commanders are good for the generality, but we cannot ſay much for our Artillery, ſome 7 field pieces we have, which we planted in <hi>Leicester</hi> lately, but becauſe we had a ſuſpition of our enemies, whom we heard they were inclining toward a march, we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Councell of War about 10 of the clock on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday night &amp; never left till we had reſolved to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our Artillery from <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and our armes and ammunition there, which was the beſt part of our ſtore, and might have been as well theirs as ours (had they beene wiſe enough) to a ſafer place, and ſo they are gone toward <hi>Nottingham;</hi> We expect ſome 10 pieces from <hi>York;</hi> I forgot to tell you the good plot we have to hold them in hand about a treaty, to which purpoſe we ſent them propoſitions by my L. <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and prudent <hi>Southampton,</hi> we made account this faire hair would have taken with them and put them upon delayes, wherein would have conſiſted our reparation and good,
